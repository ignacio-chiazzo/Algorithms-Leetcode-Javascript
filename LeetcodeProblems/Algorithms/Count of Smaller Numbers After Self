Question:
Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0]
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1]
Output: [0]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [-1,-1]
Output: [0,0]



def countSmaller(nums):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        count = 0
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                count += 1
        result.append(count)
    return result
